# Time Cell Analysis project: Python and pybind11/C++ files for analysis and demos.


## Overview

This repository contains the Matlab, Python and related files for 
Time Cell Analysis,

This is from a forthcoming paper: 

Synthetic Data Resource and Benchmarks for Time Cell Analysis and Detection Algorithms
*K. Ananthamurthy and U.S. Bhalla,* 
in preparation.

The current directory, **TcPy**, has the Python demos and code (including 
pybind11/C++ code) for the tc module for Python. 

## Examples:
---------
For the impatient, once you have installed the files, here are some things
to do from the TcPy directory. In the examples below, the input data files
are Matlab version 7.3 files, organized as `[dataset][frame#][trial#][cell#]`
These files can be generated from data analysis code, or from the synthetic
data generation programs developed in this project.

> python ti_demo.py *filename*

This will run a partial analysis for time-cells in the specified file,
and report something like this:

```
Classification of first 30 cells for Dataset 0
CellIdx sigMean    SigTI   SigBoth pkFrame   FracTrialsFired
     0       0       0       0        0       0.6000
     1       0       0       0        3       0.3833
     2       1       1       1        7       0.7167
     3       1       1       1        7       0.7167
...
Number of time cells classified by each method, for each dataset
Dataset    #SigMean    #sigBoot     #sigBoth
   0          65          67          64
   1          64          67          63
   2          66          67          64
   3          44          17          13
...
```

Similar output is obtained from *r2b_demo.py*


If your source data file is generated from the synthetic data program, you 
can run:

> python ground_truth_check.py <filename>

and it will use ground-truth data from the file to see how well the various
methods handle the data. Output is like this:

```
idx  Mau Peak Sig |   Mau TI    | Mau pk&&TI  |  r2b thresh | r2b bootstr
idx | tn fn fp tp | tn fn fp tp | tn fn fp tp | tn fn fp tp | tn fn fp tp
  0 | 68  2  0 65 | 68  1  0 66 | 68  3  0 64 | 64  1  4 66 | 29  1 39 66
  1 | 67  5  1 62 | 68  0  0 67 | 68  5  0 62 | 63  0  5 67 | 29  0 39 67
  2 | 67  2  1 65 | 66  1  2 66 | 68  3  0 64 | 61  2  7 65 | 41  2 27 65
...
```

If you want to run a batch analysis on a synthetic data file do the following. 
It will dump all the data into .csv files:

> python run_batch_analysis.py *filename*

This will generate the files `ti.csv`, `r2b.csv` and `groundTruth.csv`

Here are three lines from a sample ti,csv:

```
0,0,0.4535,-0.1383,-0.1332,0,0,0.6000,0
0,1,0.1643,-0.0821,-0.0700,0,0,0.3833,3
0,2,2.6316,-0.1009,-0.1673,1,1,0.7167,7
```

The comma-separated entries are

	- datasetIdx:	Index of the dataset, i.e. recording session.
	- cellIdx:	Index of the cell whose stats are reported on this line
	- meanScore: 	Peak of the mean of all trials for this cell
	- baseScore:	Temporal information for cell
	- percentileScore:	TI of cell vs TI of shuffled cells
	- sigMean:	Is the mean peak significantly different from shuffled?
	- sigBootstrap:	Is the TI significantly different from shuffled?
	- fracTrialsFired:	Hit Trial Ratio, fraction of trials where cell fired.
	- meanPkIdx:	Frame number of peak of mean cell activity. Note that this method bins frames (default by 3), and this is the binned frame number.

r2b.csv is very similar. r2b stands for Ridge-to-background, a metric for
the height of the peak vs the height of the shuffled peak.

	- datasetIdx:	Index of the dataset, i.e. recording session.
	- cellIdx:	Index of the cell whose stats are reported on this line
	- meanScore: 	r2b score for shuffled trials.
	- baseScore:	r2b score for original trial.
	- percentileScore:	where does r2bscore place among shuffled r2bs?
	- sigMean:	Is the base score above a threshold? Usually 3.0.
	- sigBootstrap:	Is the percentile score above a threshold? Usually 99.5
	- fracTrialsFired:	Not computed, set to 0.
	- meanPkIdx:	Frame number of peak of mean cell activity. Note that this method does not do frame binning.

finally, groundTruth.csv reports how well the different methods compare to
the ground truth, which is the known presence of time cells as put into
the synthetic data.

```
0,68,2,0,65,67,1,1,66,68,3,0,64,64,1,4,66,29,1,39,66
1,67,4,1,63,68,0,0,67,68,4,0,63,63,0,5,67,29,0,39,67
2,67,2,1,65,66,1,2,66,68,3,0,64,61,2,7,65,41,2,27,65
```

The comma-separated entries are:

	- datasetIdx:	Index of the dataset, i.e. recording session.
	- A block of four entries for the sigMean for the TI/Mau method:
		- True Negative
		- False Negative
		- False Positive
		- True Positive
	- A similar block of four entries for the TI for the TI/Mau method
	- A similar block of four entries where both sigMean and TI must be true
	- A similar block of four entries for r2b threshold
	- A similar block of four entries for r2b bootstrap score.

This module provides an interface for the Mau algorithms, the Modi algorithms,
and the data structures used to configure them.

Functions:

### tiScore

> CellScore tc.tiScore( data, analysisParams, tiAnalysisParams )

This performs the analysis of Mau et al 2018. It effectively handles
three classifications of time cells, all involving bootstrapping

	- **Returns**: an array of CellScore structures. See below.
	- **Arguments**: 
		data: Python Array of doubles organized as
		data[frameIdx][trailIdx][cellIdx]
	- analysisParams: AnalysisParams data structure, see below
	- tiAnalysisParams: TiAnalysisParams data structure, see below.

### r2bScore

> CellScore tc.r2bScore( data, analysisParams, threshold, percentile )
This performs the analysis of Modi et al 2014. It handles two
classification methods, one by thresholding and the other by bootstrapping.

	- **Returns**: an array of CellScore structures. See below.
	- **Arguments**: 
		data: Python Array of doubles organized as
		data[frameIdx][trailIdx][cellIdx]

	- analysisParams: AnalysisParams data structure, see below
	- threshold: Threshold for classifying a cell as a time cell using
		the original Modi 2014 method. A good value is 3.0.
